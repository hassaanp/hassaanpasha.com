# What am I reading?

Hello reader.

This is a personal space intended to digress from the mundane. A space which I intend to use for the following purposes:

1. To publicly commit to learning things that interest me.
2. To post my opinions on the latest trends in software development.
3. To log the issues I face with the software tools I use at work.
4. To share tips on software development for the benefit of others.

# Who am I?

My name is Hassaan. I live in Islamabad, Pakistan. I am a father to one, soon to be two, super smart girls. My lovely wife is a brilliant doctor who is currently training as a radiologist.

I work as a software engineer. I have been working in the fields of DevOps and Backend Web Development for the past 5 years.

# Why start a blog?

Why not? I have always loved writing: essays, poems and technical documents. Blogging will serve as a productive outlet for my creativity (I hope).

Also, I love learning about new technologies and software tools. But all too often I find my learning pursuits to be haphazard and disorderly. I believe committing publicly to such endeavors will give me a better focus and direction.

Lastly, I want to add more discipline in to my life. Writing a blog will help put my procrastination to better use.

# Final Thoughts

My goal is to have a positive impact on this world. I have been fortunate to have worked with amazing people and mentors who have helped make me realize my potential and pushed me to build aspirations I would have otherwise not been confident enough to pursue. I want to do the same and give back - especially to the, much overlooked, developer community of Pakistan.
