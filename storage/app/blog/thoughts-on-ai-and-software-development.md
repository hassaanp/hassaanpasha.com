Last week, OpenAI unveiled four groundbreaking features. While many are discussing these innovations, I'd like to address a broader concern: the future of software engineering in an AI-driven world. Will AI render programmers obsolete, or will it redefine traditional software development cycles and roles?

These concerns are valid, especially given the rapid advancements in AI. While I may not have all the answers, I'd like to share my perspective on the evolving landscape.

## **Embracing AI in Workflows**

If you haven't started integrating AI into your workflows, you're falling behind. AI can handle the bulk of tasks, leaving the nuances to you. My productivity, for instance, has skyrocketed. Gone are the days when I'd spend hours breaking down features or setting up tasks in JIRA. Now, I rely on AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot for giving me code or CSV formatted task breakdowns and Midjourney for UI brainstorming. Even my calendar is AI-managed with Reclaim. Even my writeups (like the one you are reading), are proofread and restructured with the help of AI. The possibilities are truly endless.

However, the real question remains: What does the future hold for software developers and humanity at large?

## **The Future?**

I foresee an increasing reliance on AI, making it as indispensable as the Internet or search engines today. In fact, I consider “ChatGPT it!” to be the new “Google it!”. The efficacy of AI integration will hinge on our expertise. For instance, if I excel in server management, I can craft precise prompts for AI to generate a virtual hosts file tailored to my needs. So, the better you are at your domain, the better you are going to be with AI for that area.

While AI might reduce the number of engineers needed in tech companies, I believe other sectors like healthcare, finance, and marketing will demand more tech-savvy professionals to embed AI into their operations. This could balance out the job market.

I do see a possibility that the over-reliance on AI will trigger a dumbing-down effect where people might not need to dive too deep into technologies or topics to be as effective as they are without AI. This can potentially slow down innovation or original thoughts and ideas. A counterpoint here could be that AI can help improve the learning process by its ability to break down concepts and ideas and actually create the opposite effect.

In any case, there is no doubt that humanity will fall into the cycle of over-reliance. I'd even go so far as to say that AI access might become a fundamental right. It might sound far-fetched, but ensuring equal AI access could prevent disparities in opportunities and advantages.
