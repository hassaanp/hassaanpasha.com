# Updates from my Opensource Journey

Hi,

My [previous blog post](https://hassaanpasha.com/posts/first-open-source-contribution/) described my journey into Opensource development and how I was able to submit my first PR to the FreeCodeCamp platform.

I have since been consistently helping out in pushing fixes, reviewing code and engaging with the community on unresolved issues.

A week ago, I was offered to become a member of the moderator team. Needless to say, I accepted and have been given access to other repositories of the FCC platform. I plan on using this opportunity to make better, more significant contributions and give back to the FCC platform.

# What I learned to improve my contributions to FCC

If you open up the [Github](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) for FreeCodeCamp, you will find that it uses Gatsby. Gatsby is an opensource framework built on React that allows you to build server-side-rendered applications. Gatsby allows you to easily enforce best practices and reduce the overhead on writing a lot of boilerplate via its library of plugins. You can learn more about it from their [official site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I went through [this course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/gatsby/) from Frontend Masters to equip myself with an introductory knowledge of Gatsby. As soon as I was done, the FCC repository became very easy to navigate and understand. This has helped me be more confident in taking on issues that I would not have otherwise.

The next items on my list are:

-   Redux
-   GraphQL

Just for your information, I have been working as a DevOps Engineer and Backend JS Developer for the last 5 years. But lately, I have been pushing myself towards the frontend domain. My experience has led me to believe that being a solid software generalist makes you more productive and reliable, especially if you work with opensource tools, start-ups or aim to architect complete software applications. I have also found being able to quickly churn out products is invaluable as a technology entrepreneur. Hence, investing time in bridging your knowledge for the various silo-ed software domains is paramount.

Takeaways for you from this post:

-   Consistent effort always pays off
-   Learn the technology behind the opensource software you want to work on
-   Aim to be a software generalist

Thanks for reading and do leave a comment if you have any questions.
