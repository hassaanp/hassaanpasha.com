It has been a year since I was here. The year 2020 has been a hard year for everyone. Especially those how lost their loved ones.

Like most countries, Pakistan also saw a surge in COVID cases towards the end of April 2020. During that time, I had started working at Teamo as a co-founder, and we had a lot of work to do to build our hiring and recruiting platforms. We were also helping new and existing clients build technology for their start-ups. I was visiting my parents at the time and it was in the start of May that my father got diagnosed with COVID.

To help him isolate, I took my family back to Islamabad and that was the last time I saw him. His condition got progressively worse and he had to be hospitalized. He breathed his last on June 3rd 2020.

Navigating his loss and supporting my family became the priority for the rest of the year. I am the eldest of four brothers and therefore, I had to muster the strength to help my mother and siblings through that time. My wife was extremely supportive and we mutually decided to leave Islamabad for good and shift to Lahore where we could all live together and support each other.

During this time, Teamo has continued a stead and slow growth. We feel like things are picking up and with a new influx of client requests, we hope to kick our OKRs out of the ball park for this year. I have become more confident on front-end technologies like ReactJS and NextJS. I was fortunate to help clients build their entire products from scratch which has been a great learning experience.

I feel that now is the right time to re-evaluate my goals.

I will be (hopefully) writing more about technologies that I have learned over the last year and what I am currently working on.

Thanks for reading and I hope you are doing well in your life.

Stay safe.
